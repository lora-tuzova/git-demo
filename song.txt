drag me to death
like a lit sigarette
took my last breath
like a smoke from my lips

i lied for you
and i liked it too
but my knees are bruised
from kneeling to you

i've had enough
but it's too hard to quit
we've had our fun
now your sugar makes me sick

i've lied for you
and i liked it too
but my makeup's ruined

and now i'm smiling through my tears
i'm crying through my fear
